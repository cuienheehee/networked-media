            I really don't get the cooled down boiled water 
            that I always have at my grandma&apos;s.
            <br/>
            I mean, I get the concept of it.
            <br/>
            you kill the germs and what not by heating it up,
            <br/>
            and then you cool it down to drink.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            but 
            <br/>
            if I'm being honest.
            <br/>
            boiled water tastes so different than tap water.
            <br/>
            I might be crazy, but
            <br/>
            I can't stand the flavour of it at all 
            no matter how hard I try.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            the metal of the kettle kind of
            <br/>
            embeds itself into the water.
            <br/>

            okay, that's enough. <a href="index.html">up we get and off we go</a>.
