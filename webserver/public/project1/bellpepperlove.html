            to be honest, <a href="bellpepperhate.html">I don't know</a> if I can ever like the taste of bell peppers.

            but I've said this about a lot of things in the past before... like
            <br/>
            <br/>
            arugula
            <br/>
            bananas
            <br/>
            lettuce
            <br/>
            pickles
            <br/>
            sesame sauce
            <br/>
            <br/>
            okay... it's a short list, but you get what I mean.
            <br/>
            the chances are low but never zero.

            <a href="love.html">let's go back</a>. I'm sure there are other things that I'm better at writing about here.
