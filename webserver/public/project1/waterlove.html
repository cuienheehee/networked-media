            even though I can't drink boiled water by itself,
            <br/>
            I do appreciate how it's essential in making so many things that I like.
            <br/>
            like tea, and noodles, and soup.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            but that's not even that important, in the grander scheme of things.
            <br/>
            when I was younger
            <br/>
            whenever I would go to my grandma&apos;s, 
            <br/>
            she would pour me a cup of cooled down boiled water.
            <br/>
            <a href="waterhate.html">I would always refuse it</a>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            she doesn't pour it for me anymore and instead offers me 
            the flavoured sports drinks that my grandpa drinks a lot.
            <br/>
            it makes me
            <br/>
            kind of sad, sometimes?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            no matter my feelings about boiled water,
            <br/>
            I don't think I would refuse it anymore.
            <br/>
