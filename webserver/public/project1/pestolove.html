            The day after I wrote the essay about how much <a href="pestohate.html">I hated pesto</a>, I had pesto for the first time.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It was actually pretty good.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I think the only reason why I dislike it now is out of spite, 
            since I already told everyone about how much of a grudge I held against it.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            that's my bad, pesto.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I think I'll come around eventually once I've learned how to stop holding petty grudges.
