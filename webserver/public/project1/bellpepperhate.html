            this is genuinely going to be just a wall of text.
            <br/>
            I will say, I used to be impartial about bell peppers, but 
            what made them cross the line was lowkey <a href="bellpepperlove.html">entirely my fault</a>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            it all started back in grade 8, where I had just made the high school jazz band 
            as a record-breaking-ly young member.
            <br/>
            I think it's just because I practiced my saxophone while nobody else in my grade did, but 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            anyways
            <br/>
            we practiced at 7am every Tuesday and Thursday before school.
            <br/>
            so one morning
            <br/>
            one morning right
            <br/>
            <br/>
            my band teacher CANCELLED jazz band and I didn't find out until I was already at school.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            so I had an hour to wander around and do nothing before school started.
            <br/>
            I went downstairs and realized that one of the classrooms had people in it.
            <br/>
            it was the student council having their <a href="stuco.html">weekly morning meeting</a>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I asked if I could listen in, and they said yes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            so then.
            <br/>
            one of the students brought out a container of sliced bell peppers (breakfast?) and asked me if I wanted one.
            <br/>
            I didn't want to be mean or anything so I said yes.
            <br/>
            why would I do that.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            and then I ate it and kept a neutral (? debatable) expression.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            for the rest of the day, everything I ate or drank had a bell pepper aftertaste.
            <br/>
            I couldn't get rid of it no matter what I did. even my saliva tasted like bell peppers.
            <br/>
            I didn't realize that they made them that strong.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            ever since that day, I've been cautious around them.
            <br/>
            I can still taste it sometimes.
            <br/>
