            to be honest, I really shouldn't have anything against pesto at all.
            <br/>
            I like basil, I like pine nuts, I like cheese, I even like olive oil.
            <br/>
            it really is just because it's a green sauce.
            <br/>
            I think I associate it with relish, which is not a sauce that I can bring myself to trust.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I even wrote a ridiculous essay about it once, 
            when I had too much time on my hands.
            <br/>
            it was purposefully horrid and went something like this:

                    Basic Pesto? More Like Basic Privilege.
                </p>
                <p class="innertext">
                    When presented with a task which is described with the word “basic”, 
                    one would usually assume that the task can be easily achieved by anyone 
                    through following the same instructions. However, the current American 
                    society seems to have lost grasp of the true meaning of “basic”. 
                    The Basic Pesto recipe, as seen on the New York Times cooking website, 
                    hints at the impossibility of achieving the American dream through the 
                    indirect references to privilege. Flawed assumptions of what constitutes 
                    “basic” and “accessible” made by Florence Fabricant, the author of the recipe, 
                    speaks of the inherent ignorance in our current day world towards issues 
                    regarding inequality.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Firstly, throughout the history of North America, communities have been divided 
                    due to systemic discrimination and segregation in a similar manner to the fresh 
                    basil that the recipe calls for. However, unlike the metaphorical divide of groups 
                    of people, the leaves and the stem of the basil are quite literally physically separated, 
                    highlighting the lack of symbiotic relationships between individuals. Much like how 
                    communities and industries rely on each other in order to create a thriving society, 
                    a basil plant cannot exist without the joint efforts of the basil leaves and stems. 
                    However, while the basil leaves become the star of the pesto show, the stems&apos; tastes 
                    are quite literally discriminated against, and are discarded without any care nor 
                    consideration for their contributions. The leaves are, quite literally, taking credit 
                    for work that they have not done simply because they have the privilege of having a “superior taste” 
                    according to societal norms. Division (similar to the division of basil leaves in the recipe) 
                    is a recurring issue throughout the history of the world. For example, the Berlin Wall, 
                    which was built in 1961, segregated communities and promoted gentrification within the city of Berlin. 
                    These communities which were segregated suffered the effects of gentrification, which erased a large part 
                    of their culture (Wikipedia). From this, one can conclude that many underappreciated people suffer. 
                    An example of this is Basil from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, who, similar to the basil 
                    in the recipe, was stabbed to death (SparkNotes). Through instructing the reader to separate parts of basil, 
                    the author highlights the reliance yet ignorance society has on the “basil stems” of the world, which is ultimately 
                    going to lead to disaster due to human nature. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Secondly, human nature is the root of a number of social constructs. In Fabricant&apos;s Basic Pesto, 
                    the author calls for her readers to “dribble in the oil”. What oil is dribbled? A singular human 
                    homosapien individual may ask. When one closely reads the recipe, they are hit in the face by the words 
                    “extra-virgin” (Fabricant). How does one truly achieve the state of extra-virginism? This impossible 
                    state of being, created by the social constructs which are caused by human nature, is something that 
                    not even a League of Legends player can achieve. The concept of virginity can be traced back to the Bible, 
                    when the Virgin Mary gave birth to Jesus Christ, which can be directly translated to “Oily Josh” 
                    (Bible.com, Matt. 1.18). This extra virgin olive oil is, in reality, a reference to the birth of “Oily Josh” 
                    by the Virgin Mary. This can be seen in how Mary is a virgin, and Jesus Christ&apos;s name directly translates 
                    to “Oily Josh”, according to Reddit user Big_Boss_Bubba. This preference, or rather idealization, of virginity, 
                    can be seen as conforming to archaic societal standards. Given that the recipe was written in the 21st century, 
                    this piece by Fabricant can be directly inferred to be against the feminist movements in the author&apos;s time.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Thirdly, when listing the ingredients for the recipe, Fabricant never once mentions the requirement of a food 
                    processor or refrigerator. This, in itself, is a juxtaposition to the word “basic” in the recipe&apos;s title, 
                    for food processors and refrigerators are items of luxury for many who struggle in the current society that 
                    juxtaposes wealth and poverty. This juxtaposition clearly exemplifies an availability heuristic, in which 
                    abricant is surrounded by people who are privileged enough to afford food processors and refrigerators, 
                    thus believing that it is the norm. This juxtaposition juxtaposed with the previous juxtapositions clearly 
                    juxtaposizes the juxtapositions which are juxtaposed within this recipe. Privilege makes the pesto taste of 
                    the bitter juxtaposition between the juxtaposed and the unjuxtaposed.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Fourthly, Fabricant&apos;s call for cheese in the pesto exposes her as a part of the infamous Milk Conspiracy. 
                    The Milk Conspiracy states that ones who are not lactose intolerant promote the milk market in order to eliminate 
                    those who are considered as “genetically inferior” (people who are lactose intolerant) (Hicks). As an immigrant 
                    Asian female woman who loves my culture and immigrated through a process of immigration, I strongly feel for my 
                    peers who are lactose intolerant and I aspire to pursue academia in order to physically, mentally, psychologically, 
                    financially, and spiritually support my cultural community, many of which suffer from the oppressive intolerance of 
                    lactose. I believe that the diverse community at the University of British Columbia will help me achieve that goal. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    To conclude, the taste of pesto might be horrid, but the message behind Basic Pesto by Florence Fabricant is 
                    beyond the aforementioned horridness. It can be clearly seen that as a community, individuals should come together 
                    and face the oppression that is pesto propaganda, or as I like to call it, <i>pestopaganda</i>.

            at that time, I hadn't even had pesto once.
            <br/>
            I think I was just excited to feel hatred towards something.
            <br/>
            now I watch <a href="sport.html">sports</a> for that.
            <br/>
            but I still haven't <a href="pestolove.html">changed my mind about pesto.</a>
            <br/>
            it just comes so naturally.
            <br/>
            <br/>
