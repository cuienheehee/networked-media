            I really like collecting things.
            <br/>
            like cards, figurines, special quaraters... so on and so forth.

            <br/>
            over time, I've developed quite the system to keep my collections looking nice and neat.
            <br/>
            I've even changed the way I collect things to better fit the way I organize them.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            however, I'm also somewhat of a completionist.
            <br/>
            and that is quite a troublesome trait to have when I'm trying to fit these collections into organizers that 
            they weren't made in mind with.
