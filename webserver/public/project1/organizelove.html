            sometimes I feel like
            <br/>
            I <a href="organizehate.html">spend too long worrying</a> about <i>how</i> I should be organizing my collection 
            than actually collecting what I love.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            shouldn't I be building my systems around my collection, and not the other way around?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            sometimes, it's really gotten to the point where I decided against something I really wanted, 
            or (even worse) bought something that I didn't really care for to make a page of cards look a little better.
            <br/>
            I really am making problems out of nothing, sometimes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            it's something that I'm working on, for sure.
